1. There is an error in minute check in the method isValid(…) in the Appt.java.
When the minute is set to 59, the result is “false”. However, it should be true. 
Therefore, the line 118 in Appt.java should be changed. In addition, the month check should 
be moved to above the “NumdaysInMonth” because there is an array Index Out Of Bounds Exception.

Location of a bug:
if(startMinute<0 || startMinute>=59)
	this.valid=false;

2. There is an error in sorting in the Appt.java. Sorting didn’t work appropriately.
Appointments are not sorted as expected. This error is based on the line number 315 
in Appt.java. Since there is no differences in dates (ex. 3+3+2018 = 4+2+2018), 
the schedules cannot be sorted. Therefore, a certain number should be multiplied 
to adjust the time variables. 

Location of a bug:
return startMinute+startHour+day+month+year;

3. There is an error in deleting a schedule in the TimeTable.java.
The deletion didn’t work appropriately. First or last schedule did not be deleted. 
This error is from the line number 210 in TimeTable.java. The for-loop is from 1 to size-1. 
However, the array is started from 0. In order to delete first/last schedule, 
it needs to chagne the range of for-loop.

Location of a bug:
for(int i=1;i<appts.size()-1;i++)
